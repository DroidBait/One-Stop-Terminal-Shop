OneStopTerminalShop
So the idea is to have a menu that can be loaded inside of a terminal which will allow the user to select from a collection of different applications. This will give the user a unified place to find many terminal applications.

Initial Program Flow Idea:
User loads OneStopTerminalShop
Menu of available application is displayed
User selects application
Application is loaded
User can return to menu.

Stretch Goals:
Allow for users to add their own applications / link to other applications
Design the code is an easily understandable way, I.E. each program has their own file.
Keep the project open source to allow for other developers to add their own applications.
A way to access new applications via a mini web app

Personal goals:
Get better at programming
Learn to use GitHub properly
Have fun
